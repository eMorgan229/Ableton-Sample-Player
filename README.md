# Ableton Sample Player
XY Sample Player
Learning Team | Software Engineer Test
This page allows a musician to play back an audio sample using a simple xy-pad control. The two-dimensional nature of this interface allows for playful interaction with many aspects of the generated sound.

While the pad is pressed, the sample should play back in a continuous loop. The sample should stop playing when the pad is released.

Moving your pointer up and down changes the playback rate of the sample. Moving your pointer left and right changes the cutoff frequency of a filter that's being applied to the sound.

Give it a try by pressing and dragging in the gray square below:

## New Features
A grid was added to enhance the user's ability to track their positioning on the pad and learn to associate their positiioning with the sound produced.

A waveform was added to enhace the user's visualization of the sound 

## Bug Fixes
Added a switch case that prevents  playback when the mouse is outside the track pad 

## Stretch Goals
Expansion upon the waveform graph below the xy-pad to be dynamic and reflect the wavelengths as they are affected by the mouse moving around the xy-pad
