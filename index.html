        <h1>XY Sample Player</h1>
        <h2>Learning Team | Software Engineer Test</h2>
        <p>
            This page allows a musician to play back an audio sample using a simple <i>xy-pad</i> control.
            The two-dimensional nature of this interface allows for playful interaction with many aspects of the generated sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the pad is pressed, the sample should play back in a continuous loop. The sample should stop
            playing when the pad is released.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving your pointer up and down changes the playback rate of the sample. Moving your pointer left
            and right changes the <i>cutoff frequency</i> of a filter that's being applied
            to the sound.
        </p>

        <p>
            Give it a try by pressing and dragging in the gray square below:
        </p>
        <section class="two_row">
            <svg class="xy_pad" id="xy_pad">
                <circle cx="50%" cy="50%" r="3" opacity="0.5"></circle>
            </svg>
            <div class="sample_display">
                <div id="loading_indicator">Loading Sample...</div>
            </div>
